# Example 7: One Compartment IV Infusion ADDL

The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how to fit a model defined by PML codes, where

* the PK portion of the model is described by a one-compartment model with zero-order absorption,
* the PD portion of the model is described by a delayed Emax model with delay time assumed to be gamma distributed

See `"OneCpt0OrderAbsorp_GammaDistributedDelayEmax.mdl"` in the same directory where this file is located for details.
