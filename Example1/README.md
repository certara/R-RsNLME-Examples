# Example 1: One Compartment First-Order Absorption Steady State

The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how to create a model involving steady state using the `Certara.RsNLME` package. The model demonstrated is a one-compartment model with first-order absorption having no time lag, using the input data `"OneCpt_1stOrderAbsorp_SteadyState.csv"`.
