# Example 10: Simulation (Two Compartment IV Bolus)

The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how to edit a built-in model and then simulate it.

The model demonstrated is a two-compartment model with an IV bolus. It involves both plasma and urine
compartments with the urine compartment reset to zero right after each observation.

The example demonstrates how to:

* Create the simulation input dataset
* Define the model and the associate column mappings
* Edit the model
* Perform simulation
* Plot simulation results using `ggplot2`
