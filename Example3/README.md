# Example 3: One Compartment Gamma Distributed Absorption Delay

The purpose of this examples is to demonstrate how to:

* Fit a model defined by PML codes (see `"OneCpt_GammaDistributedAbsorptionDelay.mdl"` in the same directory where this file is located) to the input data defined in the csv file in this directory
* Create commonly used diagnostic plots
* Perform VPC and create VPC plots through `tidyvpc` package
